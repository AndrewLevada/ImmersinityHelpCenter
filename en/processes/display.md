# Showing presentation
All presentations in Immersinity are available via the link or via connection form. The connection form requires a code and pin to access the presentation, but link already contains them. Code is an individual identifier for the presentation, and password is needed to prevent unauthorized people from connecting to your presentation.

You can get the data for the connection form and link to presentation on the control page (this page is available from storage by clicking on the [icon] (slideshow) button).

You can also turn off presentations to temporarily completely prohibit everyone from viewing. Be sure to turn on your presentation before showing it or your audience won't be able to see any content.
